                <h3>A K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify the diagnosis of breast tumours.</h3>
                <p>Currently, the medical applications of AI often receive less attention than a lot of other fields. However, the ability, and potential, of AI in regards to medicine is immense. For example, this K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm, which I built using Java for my final project of second year, has the ability to accurately classify breast tumours as benign or malignant. The algorithm shuffles and splits a dataset of over 500 lines and 30 attributes and plots the training data in a 30 dimensional feature space. The data can be visualised according to 2 of those dimensions as shown in the screenshots below. Then, with each of the unclassified examples, the algorithm looks at the nearest classified data points in the feature space and determines the unknown data point as benign or malignant based on probability. Overall, this is quite a simple algorithm, however what it says about the potential of AI in medicine is very exciting.</p>

                <h3>News Article Analyzer for Stocks</h3>
                <p>This project is coded in Python and utilises streamlit.  The app performs NLP (Natural Language Processing) analysis on the selected stock based on the latest news articles. It utilizes Google News and the VADER sentiment analysis tool to extract and analyze news sentiment. The app displays a dataframe of news articles, sentiment analysis results, and a pie chart illustrating the sentiment distribution (BUY, THINK, SELL). Additionally, it generates a word cloud visualization for the stock's news summaries. Users can input the company name to retrieve and analyze relevant news. It was created with assistance from the <a href="https://gmaifoundry.ac.uk/about/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: #0000EE;">Greater Manchester AI Foundry</a> (GMAI Foundry).</p>

                <h3>Time Series Forecasting for Stocks</h3>
                <p>Also created with assistance from the GMAI Foundry, this Python code creates an interactive AI Stock Forecaster app using Streamlit. The app allows users to select a stock from a predefined list, analyzes its historical data, and uses the Prophet library for time series forecasting. The forecasted data, including predicted values and confidence intervals, is presented through interactive Plotly charts. The app also displays raw data, forecasted components. Unfortunately, I have not been maintaining this code, so it no longer loads properly.</p>
