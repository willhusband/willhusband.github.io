                <h3>Researching the effect of generative and simple data augmentation methods for skin lesion datasets</h3>
                <p>The ability to effectively analyse skin lesions opens the door for earlier diagnoses, which leads to better treatment and lower mortality. Deep learning models present a promising avenue toward achieving this critical objective, yet the effectiveness of these models heavily hinges on the presence and quality of datasets.

                  Data augmentation is a technique of artificially increasing the size of a dataset by creating modified copies of a dataset using existing data. This study will analyse common techniques, such as cropping images or changing their brightness, and newer techniques like generative adversarial networks (GANs) which generate new data samples.
                  
                  This project will evaluate the extent that several data augmentation techniques can improve the capability of deep learning models to classify skin lesions. The methods will be applied individually to a skin lesion dataset, then run on multiple different deep learning models, ResNet and DenseNet. Each method will be evaluated on several metrics including sensitivity and AUC. These findings will be a reference point to assist in optimisation of deep learning models used in future research regarding skin lesion classification.</p>
