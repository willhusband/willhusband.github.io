                <h3>Researching the effect of generative and simple data augmentation methods for skin lesion datasets</h3>
                <h4>    Data augmentation, Generative AI, Deep learning, Python</h4>  
                <p>The ability to effectively analyse skin lesions opens the door for earlier diagnoses, which leads to better treatment and lower mortality. Deep learning models present a promising avenue toward achieving this critical objective, yet the effectiveness of these models heavily hinges on the presence and quality of datasets.

Deep learning models present a promising avenue toward achieving this critical objective, yet the effectiveness of these models heavily hinges on the presence and quality of datasets.
                  <br><br>
                  Data augmentation is a technique of artificially increasing the size of a dataset by creating modified copies of a dataset using existing data. This study analyses common data augmentation techniques, such as cropping images or changing their brightness, and newer techniques like generative adversarial networks (GANs) which generate new data samples.
                  <br><br>
                  The specific type of GAN used was a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). This was used to augment new data for each of the 8 classes of skin lesion in the ISIC 2019 dataset.
                  <br><br>
                  This project evaluated the extent that several data augmentation techniques can improve the capability of deep learning models to classify skin lesions. The methods will be applied individually to a skin lesion dataset, then run on multiple different deep learning models, ResNet and DenseNet. Each method will be evaluated on several metrics including sensitivity and AUC. These findings offer a reference point to assist in optimisation of deep learning models used in future research regarding skin lesion classification.

              <h3>GPU Optimisation for Molecular Dynamics</h3>
              <h4>    Microsoft Azure, GPU core optimisation, Linux</h4>  
              <p>In this project I was given 3 versions of a “.c” file that simulate molecular dynamics; the serial version of the code, an initial attempt at parallelisation of the code using OpenMP, and an initial attempt at parallelisation using MPI. The aim of the task was to optimise the individual executables, while ensuring the output stays correct. To compile and run code I was using Microsoft Azure. The approach I took to optimise the files was to initially apply different levels of “-O” optimisations provided by Intel. These all produced impressive results without impacting the accuracy of the output. <br><br>
                On top of this, I updated the OpenMP code through Nano. The original OpenMP code calculated certain values in a shared array; I updated this so that local variables are used and incremented with each thread in order to reduce overhead. I did this using a “reduction” pragma statement, which improved the performance of the code when running across any number of GPU cores. This code was compiled several times using different levels of Intel’s “-O” optimisations.<br><br>                
                The graph on the right shows the compile times of the original OpenMP code when compiled with different levels of “-O” optimisation on different numbers of cores. The graph on the right shows how much faster the updated OpenMP code runs with different levels of “-O” optimisation compared to the original OpenMP code.

              <h3>Using Apache Spark to analyse Transport Data</h3>
              <h4>    Apache Spark, Big Data, Python</h4>  
              <p>In this project, I aimed to test the research hypothesis: "Rides in 2014 starting from Aston Street, Stepney station were shorter compared to other stations." To analyse this, I used Apache Spark to process and clean a large dataset from Transport for London comprising multiple `.csv` files. These files were combined into a single data frame, which was then filtered to include only rides from 2014. Key columns such as "Start date," "StartStation name," and "Duration" were prepared for analysis by converting strings into appropriate data types and extracting relevant information.
                <br><br>
                The data was further divided by month to allow for a more granular analysis. For each month, I calculated metrics such as the mean journey duration from Aston Street and compared it to the mean journey duration from other stations. This comparison was carried out using t-tests from the SciPy package to determine whether the differences were statistically significant.
                <br><br>
                Finally, I aggregated the results across all months to determine the overall significance, leading to a conclusion about the initial hypothesis. The analysis showed that the hypothesis was false, as rides from Aston Street were not significantly shorter than those from other stations.

              <h3>Developing a Cross-Platform Memory Testing Game with .NET MAUI</h3>
              <h4>    Multi-platform mobile application, .NET MAUI, C#</h4>  
              <p>In this project, I developed a memory testing game using .NET MAUI, a framework designed for creating cross-platform mobile applications. The primary goal was to create an engaging and interactive game that leveraged a wide range of mobile features while ensuring compatibility across multiple operating systems, including iOS, Android, and Google.
                <br><br>
                The game was designed to test and improve the user's memory through various levels of increasing difficulty. It integrated multiple mobile features, such as haptic feedback, vibration, and torch use, to create a dynamic user experience. Additionally, the game included comprehensive accessibility settings in compliance with government standards, ensuring it was usable by a diverse audience. These settings included adjustable text sizes and dark mode support making the app accessible to users with different needs.
                <br><br>
                Throughout the development process, the app was rigorously tested on multiple devices to ensure seamless functionality across different platforms. The result was a highly compatible and user-friendly mobile game that not only entertained but also adhered to high standards of accessibility.

              <h4>    Natural language processing, Financial data analysis, Python</h4>
              <p> Using AI to assist decisions in financial markets has the prospect of being very lucrative. I have created a web application which aims to explore some of the potential of utilising AI in financial markets. This was created outside of my studies, I created it as a business, which I aim to grow. I created the application with assistance from the Greater Manchester AI Foundry (GMAI Foundry).
                <br><br>News articles can be a useful tool in financial markets as they can show the general sentiment of the market, whether people are buying or selling. However, it is hard to manually trawl through several news articles in a short space of time.                
                <br><br>This app scans the internet for news articles related to any inputted stock, determines the sentiment of these news articles using natural language processing (NLP), then creates visual tools to help the user determine what they should do. For example, a pie chart which says whether people are buying the stock, selling it, or consolidating (THINK), or a word cloud visualisation.</p>

            <h3>Building a KNN algorithm from scratch to classify tumours as benign or malignant</h3>
            <p>It is no secret about the huge potential of applying AI in medical settings. This is a K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm, which I built from scratch in java. It can accurately classify unknown data points with an accuracy of 96%. The dataset contains information on benign and malignant tumours, with 30 different attributes about their size and texture.
              <br><br>The way the algorithm works is by first shuffling the dataset of over 500 separate entries, then splitting into a training dataset, where the labels are kept, and a testing dataset, where the labels are removed so they can be predicted. Then it plots the training dataset in the sample space (graph). The sample space is of the same dimensions of 30 attributes. 
              <br><br>Next, to determine the nature of the unknown testing data, it plots the unknown data in the same sample space as the known training data. By using pythagorean distance, the algorithm calculates the unknown data points’ ‘nearest neighbours’; the labels of the nearest data points in the sample space. Whatever label is most prevalent near each unknown datapoint is the label assigned to the unknown data point, classifying each unknown data point as either showing a benign or malignant tumour. 
              <br><br>The data can be visualised according to 2 the dimensions of the feature space as shown in the screenshots below.</p>

            <h3>Building a data mart for a fictional theatre company using SQL</h3>
            <p>A problem statement set to us by the university was that a fictional theatre company had data regarding customers and shows stored in an existing database, but the existing database was outdated. The proposed solution for this problem was implementing an effective data mart. An effectively built data mart allows a business to turn raw information (data) into meaningful knowledge or content which they can act upon.
              <br><br>I first designed the fact table to be granular using a star schema to best arrange the data mart, then implemented it using Oracle SQL. The theatre company are able to use scripts to extract specific data from the database, which supplies them with valuable insights into things like customer behaviour, such as outputting the total sales for a specific show for each day of a specific month.</p>

          <h3>Deep learning for Lyme disease detection</h3>
          <p>I have already mentioned how the massive potential of applying AI to medical scenarios. I have also mentioned my plans to rigorously research the effectiveness of several data augmentation methods in the context of skin lesions. 
            <br><br>Recently, I made a small scale experiment to test the waters. This one was not specifically to detect benign or malignant skin lesions, but to detect Erytha Migrans, a common manifestation of Lyme disease on the skin. I used a database of over 3,000 images, which I tested on a ResNet50 model and a MobileNetV2 model. This was done using Python in Google Colab.
            <br><br>Unfortunately, the results were skewed. However, after looking into why the models were not performing adequately, I proved that the issue is no doubt due to poor quality of data. The data contains a lot of irrelevant images, meaning that not all 3,000 are of use to the deep learning models and skew the outputs. This only emphasises the work that must be done to increase the availability of high quality skin lesion datasets if valuable research is to be done on implementing deep learning models to this field.
            <br><br>However, the amount of quality data is slim, which is why my research into the merit of individual data augmentation techniques is important.</p>
