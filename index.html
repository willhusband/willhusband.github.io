                <h3>Researching the effect of generative and simple data augmentation methods for skin lesion datasets</h3>
                <p>The ability to effectively analyse skin lesions opens the door for earlier diagnoses, which leads to better treatment and lower mortality. Deep learning models present a promising avenue toward achieving this critical objective, yet the effectiveness of these models heavily hinges on the presence and quality of datasets.
                  <br><br>Data augmentation is a technique of artificially increasing the size of a dataset by creating modified copies of a dataset using existing data. This study will analyse common techniques, such as cropping images or changing their brightness, and newer techniques like generative adversarial networks (GANs) which generate new data samples.
                  <br><br>This project will evaluate the extent that several data augmentation techniques can improve the capability of deep learning models to classify skin lesions. The methods will be applied individually to a skin lesion dataset, then run on multiple different deep learning models, ResNet and DenseNet. Each method will be evaluated on several metrics including sensitivity and AUC. These findings will be a reference point to assist in optimisation of deep learning models used in future research regarding skin lesion classification.</p>

              <h3>Financial market analysis business</h3>
              <p> Using AI to assist decisions in financial markets has the prospect of being very lucrative. I have created a web application which aims to explore some of the potential of utilising AI in financial markets. This was created outside of my studies, I created it as a business, which I aim to grow. I created the application with assistance from the Greater Manchester AI Foundry (GMAI Foundry).
                <br><br>News articles can be a useful tool in financial markets as they can show the general sentiment of the market, whether people are buying or selling. However, it is hard to manually trawl through several news articles in a short space of time.                
                <br><br>This app scans the internet for news articles related to any inputted stock, determines the sentiment of these news articles using natural language processing (NLP), then creates visual tools to help the user determine what they should do. For example, a pie chart which says whether people are buying the stock, selling it, or consolidating (THINK), or a word cloud visualisation.</p>

            <h3>Building a KNN algorithm from scratch to classify tumours as benign or malignant</h3>
            <p>It is no secret about the huge potential of applying AI in medical settings. This is a K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm, which I built from scratch in java. It can accurately classify unknown data points with an accuracy of 96%. The dataset contains information on benign and malignant tumours, with 30 different attributes about their size and texture.
              <br><br>The way the algorithm works is by first shuffling the dataset of over 500 separate entries, then splitting into a training dataset, where the labels are kept, and a testing dataset, where the labels are removed so they can be predicted. Then it plots the training dataset in the sample space (graph). The sample space is of the same dimensions of 30 attributes. 
              <br><br>Next, to determine the nature of the unknown testing data, it plots the unknown data in the same sample space as the known training data. By using pythagorean distance, the algorithm calculates the unknown data points’ ‘nearest neighbours’; the labels of the nearest data points in the sample space. Whatever label is most prevalent near each unknown datapoint is the label assigned to the unknown data point, classifying each unknown data point as either showing a benign or malignant tumour. 
              <br><br>The data can be visualised according to 2 the dimensions of the feature space as shown in the screenshots below.</p>

            <h3>Building a data mart for a fictional theatre company using SQL</h3>
            <p>A problem statement set to us by the university was that a fictional theatre company had data regarding customers and shows stored in an existing database, but the existing database was outdated. The proposed solution for this problem was implementing an effective data mart. An effectively built data mart allows a business to turn raw information (data) into meaningful knowledge or content which they can act upon.
              <br><br>I first designed the fact table to be granular using a star schema to best arrange the data mart, then implemented it using Oracle SQL. The theatre company are able to use scripts to extract specific data from the database, which supplies them with valuable insights into things like customer behaviour, such as outputting the total sales for a specific show for each day of a specific month.</p>

          <h3>Deep learning for Lyme disease detection</h3>
          <p>I have already mentioned how the massive potential of applying AI to medical scenarios. I have also mentioned my plans to rigorously research the effectiveness of several data augmentation methods in the context of skin lesions. 
            <br><br>Recently, I made a small scale experiment to test the waters. This one was not specifically to detect benign or malignant skin lesions, but to detect Erytha Migrans, a common manifestation of Lyme disease on the skin. I used a database of over 3,000 images, which I tested on a ResNet50 model and a MobileNetV2 model. This was done using Python in Google Colab.
            <br><br>Unfortunately, the results were skewed. However, after looking into why the models were not performing adequately, I proved that the issue is no doubt due to poor quality of data. The data contains a lot of irrelevant images, meaning that not all 3,000 are of use to the deep learning models and skew the outputs. This only emphasises the work that must be done to increase the availability of high quality skin lesion datasets if valuable research is to be done on implementing deep learning models to this field.
            <br><br>However, the amount of quality data is slim, which is why my research into the merit of individual data augmentation techniques is important.</p>

        <h2>Footnote - App Development, Spark, and Future Prospects</h2> 
        <p>I am also in the early stages of developing an app, and using Spark to process large datasets. These projects are in their early stages so I can not meaningfully write about them.
          <br><br>Also, it is clear that a lot of my work surrounds medical applications of AI. While I am deeply interested in the potential of applying AI to medical situations, my knowledge and interest is not limited to these fields. My interest in AI spans industries and I am excited to explore many different possible paths of applying my knowledge.</p>
